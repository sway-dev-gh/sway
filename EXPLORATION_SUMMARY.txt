  5. Advanced workflow features incomplete

NEXT DEVELOPMENT PHASES:
  Tier 1: Connect frontend pages to existing APIs
  Tier 2: Complete missing features (review, workflow)
  Tier 3: Add real-time collaboration and advanced features
  Tier 4: Polish, accessibility, and optional features

  • Security strength/weakness assessment

RECOMMENDATIONS
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

IMMEDIATE (This Week):
  1. Read both new documentation files completely
  2. Start Tier 1 implementation (API data binding)
  3. Create component for project list UI
  4. Add API calls to Dashboard and Workspace pages

SHORT-TERM (This Sprint):
  1. Complete all Tier 1 tasks (Dashboard, Workspace, Teams, Reviews)
  2. Wire Settings form to API endpoints
  3. Add error handling and loading states
  4. Implement basic modals and confirmation dialogs

MID-TERM (Next Sprint):

CONCLUSION
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SwayFiles is a well-architected full-stack application with a strong backend
foundation, comprehensive APIs, and production-ready database schema. The 
frontend scaffold is complete but requires data binding to connect to the 
backend APIs.

The project is ready for Phase 2 development (API integration) and can achieve
MVP status by completing Tier 1-2 implementation priorities. Advanced features
and real-time collaboration can follow after the core functionality is complete.

The codebase demonstrates excellent security practices, proper architecture
patterns, and thorough planning. With focused effort on the identified gaps,
the project can move from MVP to production-ready status within 2-3 sprints.
